Libraries needed

numpy,os,glob,tkinter,sklearn,PIL,pickle,random,matplotlib,cv2,pandas,keras

All these commands can be installed by using python package manager (PIP), and some like tkinter are generally pre installed.

For eg. pip install sklearn
		pip install pandas
		
Also these libraries can be installed manually by going to the appropiate download links and choosing the correct one for your system (for some libraries we weren't able to 
find exact links, hence we have provided links to websites which server nearly identical packages, often differing just by version.
